# SpeciBots

Booking chat sessions with specialized chatbots fine-tuned for conversations that require the most accurate results most efficiently.

**Note:** This project was built for as part of coursework for a course I'm taking at my university. This only contains the code for front-end, i.e., **there is no backend** connected to the app yet, and the front-end is also just a prototype not final version, so lacks certain features and validation. Feel free to use the code or idea :)

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
